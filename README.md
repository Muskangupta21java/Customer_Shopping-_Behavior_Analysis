# Data Analytics Project – README

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Data Analytics workflow** using industry-standard tools. The goal is to extract insights from raw data by performing data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and data visualization, and then present the findings through dashboards, reports, and presentations.

This project is designed to be **simple, professional, and recruiter-friendly**, showcasing practical data analytics skills.

## Project Workflow (Steps)

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported dataset into Python using Pandas
   * Connected to SQL databases where required

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed data structure, distributions, and trends
   * Identified missing values and outliers
   * Generated summary statistics and visualizations

3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handled missing and duplicate values
   * Standardized data formats
   * Removed inconsistencies for accurate analysis

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Wrote SQL queries to:

     * Filter and aggregate data
     * Perform joins and subqueries
     * Extract meaningful insights

5. **Dashboard Development (Power BI)**

   * Built interactive dashboards
   * Used KPIs, charts, and slicers
   * Enabled data-driven decision-making

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a detailed analytical report
   * Designed a professional PPT using Gamma
   * Summarized insights and recommendations

---

## Dashboard

* **Tool:** Power BI
* **Key Features:**

  * Interactive filters and slicers
  * Trend analysis and KPI tracking
  * Clear visual storytelling

---

## Results & Insights

* Identified key trends and patterns in the dataset
* Discovered actionable insights through SQL and visual analysis
* Improved data quality through systematic cleaning
* Presented insights in a clear and business-friendly manner
